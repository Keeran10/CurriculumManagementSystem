[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Keeran10/CurriculumManagementSystem.svg?token=MoxxqDdGkV24zknvVVL5&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Keeran10/CurriculumManagementSystem)

The Curriculum Management System will be a software-as-a-service providing University faculty members the necessary tools to modify their respective  University Academic Calendar. The objectives of the CMS are the following:

- Create a database with the potential to hold all information from diverse academic calendars. 
- Implement a responsive and user-friendly user interface. 
- Assess change requests and provide an overview of possible impact of changes.
- Implement approval process pipelines to review calendar modification requests. These pipelines will send the many types of requests to their appropriate academic bodies (councils, committees, senate). 
- Automate as much of the curriculum management process as possible.
